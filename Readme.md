# NCH (or meowcat, or sneakerchat, or chatcat)

To run it:

```bash
./nch general #or some other channel name
```

Now, to connect from one to the other, type:

```
++host-name-to-connect-to
```

So if you want to connect to a hostname of `sneakercomp.local`, it would be:

```
++sneakercomp.local
```

Then just chat away!
